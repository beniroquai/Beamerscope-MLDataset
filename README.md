# Beamerscope-MLDataset
A small set from the Dataset to learn the best light-source shape. 

This is the Algorithm for the Paper: "Using Machine-Learning to Optimize phase contrast in a Low-Cost Cellphone Microscope" implemented in TENSORFLOW.

Some images were generated using the DCT from Numpy. The biological images are coming from http://www.cellimagelibrary.org/, thus the rights stay with the owner.
